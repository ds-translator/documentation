Define the context, the objectives, as well as the scope of the project
The context must define the environment and framework in which the project is held: stakeholders, expectations, deadlines...
The scope is intended to outline the project and its objectives, especially according to resources and time available. It can also be defined by phases or levels.
Collect and organize requirements:
Functional requirements: those of the different users, of the internal and external stakeholders (devs, ops, SRE, marketing, product, users/customers,...). The structure of this part can therefore correspond to their roles.
Non-functional requirements: those for the system itself. Apart from those possibly arising directly from the objectives, they arise from the functional requirement, for example, to have a service always as efficient (marketing, users) and reliable (SRE, Ops) whatever the load.
