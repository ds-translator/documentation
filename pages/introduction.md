Define the context, the objectives, as well as the scope of the project

# Context

The project is a 6-week DevOps initiative to develop and deploy a speech-to-speech translation webservice. The service will allow users to input speech in one language and receive translated speech in another language. 

The project will showcase DevOps capabilities, including:

- CI/CD pipelines
- cloud infrastructure management
- containerization and orchestration in a cluster
- monitoring
- source code management

## Deadlines

**Subject: Define the context, the objectives, as well as the scope of the project**

> Deliverables:
> - Requirements:
>   - Context, objectives, scope and requirements that will guide the project and be used for decision making in all subsequent phases.
>   - Detailed plan/outline/tables (will be used for the writing of the submission).
> - Specifications
>   - Detailed plan/outline/tables of specifications
>   - Components diagram
>   - Solutions stack
>   - High-level functional, architectural, implementation schematics and diagrams...
> - Project & SCM
>   - Setup of the collaborative organization, users, project, milestones, first epics/stories/issues
>   - Repositories: strategy (mono/multi), structure (app, infra, modules, charts, etc.), and initialization
>   - Source code management flow (Git flow, GitLab Flow, etc.) and branches

### Week 5 (27.01.-02.02.), Step 2: CI/CD

**Subject: define and implement automation of the integration and deployment chain for infrastructure and applications.**

> Deliverables: 
> - Provisioning of isolated deployment environments corresponding to the defined development, delivery and deployment cycle
> - Test, build, delivery and deployment procedures
> - Unified and automated processes for integration and deployment across branches and environments

### Week 6 (03.02.-09.02.): Step 3: Infrastructure

**Subject: define and automate the provisioning and configuration of system infrastructure and services using IaC/CaC tools and techniques.**

> Deliverables:
> - Root account, organization, and users
> - Operational and compliant cloud infrastructure
> - Infrastructure provisioning and configuration manifests, scripts, and files maintained in a VCS.

### Week 7 (10.02.-16.02.), Step 4: Data
**Subject: Create and configure data storage resources (block, file, object, databases, caches) with authentication, authorization and access control, logging. Import data and configure a data backup and restore solution**

> Deliverables:
> - Operational and application/user accessible data according to defined requirements
> - Backup/restore scripts and/or procedures

### Week 8 (17.02.-23.02.), Step 5: Observability
**Subject: monitor and collect system analysis data in its entirety and in the various environments to detect malfunctions and allow for improvement.**

> Deliverables:
> * Centralized and integrated solution that watches over the entire system
> * Accessible dashboards
> * Alert system in operation

### Week 9 (24.02.-02.03.), Step 6 prep: Presentation, Demo, and Pre-defense

### Week 10 (03.03.-09.03.), Step 6: DataScientest Defense & Demo
> Deliverables:
> - Presentation slides
> - For your demo, your application must be:
>   - Organized and documented in a code repository
>   - Provided with an installation procedure
>   - Functional.



The context must define the environment and framework in which the project is held: stakeholders, expectations, deadlines...


# Scope





The scope is intended to outline the project and its objectives, especially according to resources and time available. It can also be defined by phases or levels.
Collect and organize requirements:
Functional requirements: those of the different users, of the internal and external stakeholders (devs, ops, SRE, marketing, product, users/customers,...). The structure of this part can therefore correspond to their roles.
Non-functional requirements: those for the system itself. Apart from those possibly arising directly from the objectives, they arise from the functional requirement, for example, to have a service always as efficient (marketing, users) and reliable (SRE, Ops) whatever the load.
