The project will showcase DevOps capabilities, including:

- CI/CD pipelines
- cloud infrastructure management
- containerization and orchestration in a cluster
- monitoring
- source code management

## Deadlines

### Week 5: Step 2: CI/CD

**Subject: define and implement automation of the integration and deployment chain for infrastructure and applications.**

Deliverables: 
- Provisioning of isolated deployment environments corresponding to the defined development, delivery and deployment cycle
- Test, build, delivery and deployment procedures
- Unified and automated processes for integration and deployment across branches and environments

### Week 6: Step 3: Infrastructure

**Subject: define and automate the provisioning and configuration of system infrastructure and services using IaC/CaC tools and techniques.**

> Deliverables:

### Week 7: Step 4: Data
**Subject: Create and configure data storage resources (block, file, object, databases, caches) with authentication, authorization and access control, logging. Import data and configure a data backup and restore solution**

> Deliverables:
> - Operational and application/user accessible data according to defined requirements
> - Backup/restore scripts and/or procedures

- Week 8: Step 5: Observability

- Week 9: Step 6 prep: Presentation, Demo, and Pre-defense

The context must define the environment and framework in which the project is held: stakeholders, expectations, deadlines...


# Scope





The scope is intended to outline the project and its objectives, especially according to resources and time available. It can also be defined by phases or levels.
Collect and organize requirements:
Functional requirements: those of the different users, of the internal and external stakeholders (devs, ops, SRE, marketing, product, users/customers,...). The structure of this part can therefore correspond to their roles.
Non-functional requirements: those for the system itself. Apart from those possibly arising directly from the objectives, they arise from the functional requirement, for example, to have a service always as efficient (marketing, users) and reliable (SRE, Ops) whatever the load.
