# Context

The project is a 6-week DevOps initiative to develop and deploy a speech-to-speech translation webservice. The service will allow users to input speech in one language and receive translated speech in another language.

The project will showcase DevOps capabilities, including:

- CI/CD pipelines
- cloud infrastructure management
- containerization and orchestration in a cluster
- monitoring
- source code management

Its expected to define everything by code (IaC), to have a reproducible and sustainable solution with easy maintenance.

## Stakeholders

**DevOps Engineers:** Reproducible infrastructure, easy maintenance, monitoring of all components.

**Developers:** Easy code changes, reliable API architecture, error monitoring.

**QA Engineers:** Automated testing frameworks, clear bug reporting processes.

**Customer:** 100% uptime, notifications for downtime, scalability with user growth.

**Users:** Always reachable website, fast and accurate translations, data privacy.

# Objectives

**Primary Objective:** Deliver a scalable, secure, and high-availability speech-to-speech translation webservice within 6 weeks.

**Specific Goals:**
- Implement a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Build automated CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
- Ensure 99.9% uptime for the production environment.
- Provide real-time monitoring and alerting for all components.
- Achieve data security through encryption and private networks.
- Support scalability to handle increasing user loads.

# Scope

The project will deliver a speech-to-speech translation webservice with the following features:

- Core Functionality: Translate user speech from one language to another.

- Deployment: Hosted on AWS with a microservices architecture.

- Scalability: Auto-scaling for both frontend and backend.

- Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of pipelines, staging, and production environments.

- Security: Encrypted connections (TLS), private subnets, and role-based access control.

- Self-Sustained: No reliance on external translation APIs; all services built in-house.

### Phase 1: Setup
Set up project management tools, GitHub repositories, and cloud accounts.
Deliverables: Project board, repository structure, and AWS accounts ready.

### Phase 2: Development
	
Adapt source code, set up Docker images, and implement CI/CD pipelines.
Deliverables: Docker images for all microservices, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

### Phase 3: Staging
	
Set up cloud infrastructure for staging/release branch.
Deliverables: Staging environment deployed and tested.

### Phase 4: Monitoring
	
Integrate cloud monitoring and alerting tools.
Deliverables: AWS CloudWatch, Grafana, and alerting systems operational.

### Phase 5: Production

Deploy and monitor the production environment.
Deliverables: Production environment live, monitored, and scalable.
