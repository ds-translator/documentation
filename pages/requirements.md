Interactions

    Users interact with the frontend, which sends requests to the backend.

    The backend processes speech, interacts with the translation engine, and stores data in the database.

    CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment to staging and production environments.

    Monitoring tools track performance and alert the team to issues.
