This repo holds the raw documentation.

The workflow will automatically generate pages and publish them in the projects Confluence wiki.

Diagrams will also automatically generated and uploaded to the specific page.

The Confluence user id and API token is stored as an environment secret in this repo.

We use an adaptation of [GitHub to Confluence Publisher](https://github.com/andygolubev/github-to-confluence-publisher) and [Python diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/).
